## What is a Scripting Language?
- A `script` is a set of programming instructions that is interpreted at runtime.
- A `script language` is a language that interprets scripts at runtime.
- PHP is a **server side script** while, for example, JavaScript is a client side script language that is interpreted by the client browser.

## What does PHP stand for?
- PHP => acronym: **Personal Home Page** but now stands for **Hypertext Preprocessor** as a recursive backcronym.

## PHP Syntax
```php
<?php
	echo 'Hello, World!';
?>
```

You may also add HTML tags or client side scripts like JS in PHP file.

## Advantages of PHP
- **Open source and free**
- Large community document
- Most web hosting servers support PHP by default => cost effective
- updated regularly
- **server side scripting language**
- PHP has **in build support for MySQL**
- **cross platform**

## Data Types
- **Strings** => alphanumeric charactetrs
- **Interegs** => whole numbers
- **float** => numbers with decimal points
- **Boolean** => true of false

```php
<?php
 echo PHP_INT_MAX; // 2^63 - 1
 
 echo "Hello World!";
 
 echo 123; 
 echo 3.14; 
 
 echo True; // 1
 echo true; // 1
 
 echo False; // ''
 echo false; // ''
 ?\>
 ```
 
 ## Variable
 - **Local variable** => accessible to the script it was defined in.
 - **Global variable** => accessible to all scripts in an application.
 
 ```php
 <?php
 $greeting = "Hello World!";
 echo $greeting; // Hello World!
 
 $my_var = 1;
 echo $my_var;	// 1
 $my_var = 3.14;
 echo $my_var;	// 3.14
 ?>
 ```
 
 ## Variable Type Casting
 - Type casting is done by the interpreter (implicit).
 - You can also type cast explicitly:
   ```php
   <?php
   $a = 1;
   $b = 1.5;
   $c = $a + $b;
   echo $c;	// 2.5
   $c = $a + (int)$b;
   echo $c;	// 2
   ?>
   ```
   
You can use `var_dum($var)` to check the data type of a variable.
```php
<?php
 $a = 1;
 var_dump($a);
 $b = 1.5;
 var_dump($b);
 $c = $a + $b;
 var_dump($c);
 $c = $a + (int)$b;
 var_dump($c);

// output:
// int(1) float(1.5) float(2.5) int(2)
?>
```

## Constant Variable
- **constant** is a variable whose value cannot be changed at runtime.

```php
<?php
 define('PI', 3.14159);
 $PI = 3.14;
 
 echo PI;	// 3.14159
 echo $PI;	// 3.14
?>
```

## Arithmetic Operators
- Addition (`+`)
- Subtraction (`-`)
- Multiplication (`*`)
- Division (`/`)
- Modulus (`%`)
- Negation (`-n`)
- Concatenation(`x. y`) - but seems like I can use `x , y` as well.

## Comparison Operators
- Equal (`1 == "1"`) => True(1)
- Identical (`1 === "1"`) => False(0)
- Not equal (`2 != 1` or `2 <> 1`) => True(1)
- Greater than (`3 > 1`) => True(1)
- Less than (`2 < 1`) => False(0)
- Greater than or equal (`1 >= 1`) => True(1)
- Less than or equal (`8 <= 6`) => False(0)

## Logical Operators
- And (`x and y` or `x && y`)
- Or (`x or y` or `x || y`)
- XOR (`x xor y`)
- Not (`!x`)

## include & include_once
- used to include other PHP files.

```php
<?php
include 'file_name';
include_once 'file_name';
?>
```

- **include** => insert contents of a file.
- **include_once** => insert contents of a file *if and only if* the file has not been included yet; it prevents including the same file twice.

## require & require_once
- used to include other PHP files.

```php
<?php
require 'file_name';
require_once 'file_name';
?>
```

- **require** => insert contents of a file.
- **require_once** => insert contents of a file *if and only if* the file has not been included yet; it prevents including the same file twice.

## include vs. require
- include
	+ issues a warning when an error occurs and execution continues
- require
	+ no warning but stops the execution
	
Generally it's recommended to use `include` so that when there's an error, the script continues to display the contact info.

The `require` should be used if the entire script cannot run without the requested file.

## Arrays

### Numeric Array
- It uses integer as an access key.

```php
<?php
$variable_name[n] = value;

$variable_name = array( n => value, ... );
?>
```

Example,

```php
<?php
 $names = array( 0 => 'Eu', 
 				1 => 'Kim' );
 $names[2] = 'Park';
 $names[3] = 'Chris';
 
 // names = ['Eu', 'Kim', 'Park', 'Chris']
?>
```

### Associative Array
- It uses descriptive names for id keys.
```php
<?php
$variable_name['key_name'] = value;

$variable_name = array( 'keyname' => value, ... );
?>
```

Example,

```php
 <?php
 $eubug = array( 'name' => 'Eubug', 
				 'sex' => 'Male', 
				 'job' => 'Junior FE', 
				 'age' => '20' );

 print\_r($eubug);
 // Array ( \[name\] => Eubug \[sex\] => Male \[job\] => Junior FE \[age\] => 20 )
 ?>
 ```
