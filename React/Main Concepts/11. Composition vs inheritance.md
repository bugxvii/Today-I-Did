> React recommend using composition instead of inheritance to reduce code between components.

## Containment
Components like `Sidebar` or `Dialog` that represent generic "boxes" don't their children ahead of time.

In this case, we can use the special `children` prop of a component to pass children elements directly into their output:
```jsx
function FancyBorder(props) {
	return (
		<div className={'FancyBorder FancyBorder-' + props.color }>
			{props.children}
		</div>
	);
}
```

This lets other components pass arbitrary children to them by nesting the JSX:
```jsx
function WelcomeDialog() {
	return (
		<FancyBorder color="blue">
			<h1 className="Dialog-title">
				Welcome
			</h1>
			<p className="Dialog-message">
				Thank you for visiting our spacecraft!
			</p>
		</FancyBorder>
	);
}
```

So anything inside the `<FancyBorder>` tag will be passed into  the `FancyBorder` component as a `children` prop in `{props.children}`.

There are no limitations on what you can pass as a props in React. So this approach is less common, but you can do this:

```jsx
function SplitPane(props) {
	return (
		<div className="SplitPane">
			<div className="SplitPane-left">
				{props.left}
			</div>	
			<div className="SplitPane-right">
				{props.right}
			</div>
		</div>
	);
}

function App() {
	return (
		<SplitPane
			left={
				<Contacts />
			}
			right={
				<Chat />
			} 
		/>
	);
}
```

This approach is similar to using "slots" in other libraries.

## Specialization

Their are special cases where we want to configure our reusable component to fit in a specific setting. For example, `WelcomeDialog` is a special case of `Dialog`.

To achieve this by composition in React, a more "specific" component (`WelcomeDialog`) renders a more "generic" one (`Dialog`) and configures it with props:

```jsx
function Dialog(props) {
	return (
		<FancyBorder color="blue">
			<h1 className="Dialog-title">
				{props.title}
			</h1>
			<p className="Dialog-message">
				{props.message}
			</p>
		</FancyBorder>
	);
}

function WelcomeDialog() {
	return (
		<Dialog
			title="Welcome"
			message="Thank you for visiting our spacecrafte!"
		/>
	);
}
```

> Composition works equally wells for components defined as classes.
