## Thinking in React 

### Step 1: Break the UI into a  component hierarchy
Start by drawing boxes around every component (and subcomponent) in the mock and give them all names. If you're working with a designer, go talk to them. Their layer name may end up being our component names.

- **Single Responsibility Principle** : a component should ideally only do one thing. If it ends up growing, it should be decomposed into smaller subcomponents.

### Step 2: Build a static version in React
Build a static version of your data that renders the UI but has no interactivity.
